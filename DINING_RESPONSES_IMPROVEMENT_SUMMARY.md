## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Improvements Made**

### **1. Complete Response System Overhaul**

- **Before:** Simple `createListingResponse()` with basic logic
- **After:** Comprehensive question analysis with 5 specialized response types:

  - `specific-restaurant` - For individual restaurant questions
  - `location-based` - For location/area questions

private analyzeQuestionType(questionLower: string): string {
  // Analyzes question keywords to determine best response type
  // Routes to specialized response generators
}
```

### **3. Specialized Response Generators**

Created 5 new specialized response functions:
- `createDetailedOverviewResponse()` - Comprehensive dining overviews
- `createSpecificCuisineResponse()` - Cuisine-specific detailed answers
- `createSpecificRestaurantResponse()` - Restaurant-specific information
