## **❌ Questions with Unsatisfactory Answers**

### **1. Question 7: "Is there 24-hour parking available?"**
**Current Status:** ❌ POOR (Score: 2/10)

**Issues Identified:**
- **Intent Classification Problem:** Query is classified as "transportation" but not properly routed to parking-specific handlers
- **Detection Failure:** Despite multiple detection patterns, the query is not being detected as `parking_info`
- **Generic Response:** Returns generic transportation overview instead of specific 24-hour availability information
- **Missing Information:** Doesn't answer the yes/no question about 24-hour availability

**Current Response:**
```
Transportation Options at Muscat Airport:
🚗 Parking: Multiple parking areas with hourly and daily rates
🚕 Taxis: Available 24/7 from arrivals hall
🚌 Buses: Public buses operated by Mwasalat
🚐 Shuttles: Hotel shuttle services available
🚙 Car Rental: Multiple companies available 24/7
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- Clear YES/NO answer about 24-hour availability
- Specific information about which parking areas are available 24/7
- 24-hour rates and services
- Security and safety information for overnight parking
- Payment station availability

**Technical Investigation Needed:**
- Check why detection patterns aren't matching
- Verify intent classification logic
- Test alternative query phrasings
- Review query routing in `buildResponseFromWebContent` method

### **2. Question 8: "How much does it cost to park for a week?"**
**Current Status:** ❌ FAILED (Score: 1/10)

**Issues Identified:**
- **Wrong Intent Classification:** Query is classified as "general_info" (0.4 confidence) instead of "transportation"
- **Complete Failure:** Returns generic "I'd be happy to help..." fallback response
- **No Cost Information:** Doesn't provide any weekly parking cost calculations
- **Poor Confidence:** Low confidence score indicates fundamental detection problems

**Current Response:**
```
I'd be happy to help you with information about Oman Airports. Could you please be more specific about what you'd like to know?
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- Weekly parking cost calculation (7 days × daily rate)
- Comparison between P1 and P3 weekly costs
- Recommendation for long-term parking (P3)
- Breakdown of daily rates after first 24 hours
- Total cost examples for different parking areas

**Technical Investigation Needed:**
- Fix intent detection for weekly/monthly parking queries
- Add specific patterns for duration-based cost queries
- Enhance detection for "week", "weekly", "7 days" patterns
- Improve confidence scoring for parking-related queries

## **🔧 Technical Issues Summary**

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Intent Detection Problems:** Some parking queries are not being properly classified as "transportation" intent
2. **Query Type Detection Issues:** Even when classified as transportation, specific parking queries aren't being routed to appropriate handlers
3. **Pattern Matching Failures:** Detection patterns may not be comprehensive enough to catch all variations
4. **Fallback Behavior:** System falls back to generic responses instead of providing helpful parking information

### **Areas Requiring Investigation:**
1. **Intent Classification Logic** - Review `detectIntent` method for parking-related queries
2. **Query Type Detection** - Enhance `detectQueryType` method patterns
3. **Transportation Handler Routing** - Verify proper routing in `buildResponseFromWebContent`
4. **Confidence Scoring** - Improve confidence calculations for parking queries
